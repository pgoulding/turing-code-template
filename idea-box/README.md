Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say “the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them.” In this project, we’ll be building an application a new client that records and archives our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript and to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions. Our goal is to also incorporate an agile workflow by incorporating two weekly sprints.
